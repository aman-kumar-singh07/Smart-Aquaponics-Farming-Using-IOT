# Smart-Aquaponics-Farming-Using-IOT
The smart aquaponics farming system is feasible and cost-effective for optimizing water resources for
agricultural production. Using the aquaponics farming system, we can prove that the use of water can be
reduced for different agricultural usage.

This proposed system is Arduino based system developed for the agricultural plantation, which is
placed at the remote location and required water provides for plantation when the humidity of the soil
goes below the set-point value. But in this we did not aware about the soil moisture level so to overcome
this drawback proposed system included with extra feature soil moisture value and temperature value which
displayed on the farmer mobile application or on the LCD display attached to the system. 
The central processing unit will also include communication device to receive data from the sensors and to
be relayed to the userâ€™s device. This will be done using a higher communication device such as a Wi-Fi module. 
The data processed by the central module is converted to meaningful data and relayed to the user. The user can view
the data with the help of a handheld device such as a mobile phone or a tablet. Nowadays water scarcity is a big concern for farming.
 
This project helps the farmers to irrigate the farmland in an efficient manner with automated irrigation system.
Here is our project "Smart Aquaponics Farming System Using IOT". We have designed a prototype combining 
aquaculture and geoponics in which the required nutrients from the fish waste is supplied to the soil, enriching the soil
 and enhancing plant growth. We are controlling different parameters and continuosly monitoring them like moisture, temperature, 
humidity, raining or not raining, light source just  through the button on the app (TCP server) on your android smartphone.

Software Used : Arduino IDE
Hardware Used : Arduino Microcontroller, Wi-Fi module(ESP8266), Rain Sensor,
Moisture sensor module (LM393 module) [2 units], Temperature and Humidity Sensor , Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), Grow Light LED
DC Water Pump (9V-12V), Single Relay Module (5V), Battery Power Supply (9V)
LCD Module ,Potentiometer
10k-ohm Resistor [2 units].

Here I am attaching the readings displayed on the app,photo of 
the prototype and also the code.
